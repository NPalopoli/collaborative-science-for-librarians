First, we will delve into the concept of digital accessibility and its pivotal role in guaranteeing equitable access to scientific information and resources. 

Next, we will work towards acquiring the knowledge and tools required to promote the FAIR Principles, facilitating the efficient organization and sharing of data. 

Lastly, we will acquaint ourselves with the CARE Principles, which highlight ethical responsibilities and make valuable contributions to a more accessible and inclusive open science ecosystem.

## Digital accesibility in open science

In educational and research institutions, groups are characterized by a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, gender identities, native languages, socioeconomic statuses, ages, abilities, among other attributes. Individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination or privilege simultaneously, based on these intersecting social identities.  

As a fundamental human right, digital accessibility seeks to eliminate attitudinal, policy, and social barriers to enable all individuals to fully engage in the digital world.

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 7, 2023, 1 in every 6 people worldwide experiences a significant disability (1.3 billion individuals).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Some Latin American estimations:


- In Argentina, the population aged six years and older with "some disability" comprises 10.2%. An estimated 3,571,983 individuals. (2018)
- In Chile, 16.7% of the population has some form of disability. An estimated 2,836,818 people. (2016)
- In the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, disability prevalence stands at 7.6% among the population residing in urban private households in cities with 5,000 or more inhabitants. An estimated 210,400 individuals (2004)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Digital accessibility ensures that technologies and information are available and effectively usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. Its promotion fosters autonomy, social inclusion, and equal opportunities in the digital society. It benefits individuals with disabilities, older adults, those with limited technological literacy, and those who rely on assistive devices.

### Promoting digital accesibility in research

Librarians play a crucial role in improving digital accessibility by providing support, resources, and guidance. Let's start by identifying some key elements of digital accessibility:

- **Text content** should be clear, concise, and formatted in a simple manner. This helps users to easily understand and navigate information.

- **Images** should provide alternative text or alt text that describes the content and function of the image, making them accessible to individuals who use screen readers or have visual impairments.

- **Color** combinations should have sufficient contrast to ensure readability for all users. This is especially important for text and background colors to accommodate individuals with visual impairments.

- **Videos** should include subtitles and audio content. Subtitles provide a text-based version of spoken content, benefiting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

- **Transcripts** for video and audio content should be available. Transcripts provide a written version of spoken content, making it accessible to those who prefer to read or need an alternative format.

#### There are different ways in which librarians can contribute to enhance accessibility for researchers:

- Teach about digital accessibility best practices. 

- Help creating accessible documents, websites, and presentations. 

- Curate and promote accessible resources, databases, and platforms. 

- Provide consultations for researchers who need assistance making their research materials and presentations accessible. 

- Make accessibility tools and software available to researchers and guide them on how to use them.

- Offer document conversion services to make research materials accessible. 

- Ensure that library spaces, including computer labs and study areas, are physically accessible to researchers with disabilities.

- Create channels for researchers to provide feedback on the accessibility issues they encounter. 

Bear in mind that thinking about accessibility helps create and promote digital products and interfaces that are intuitive, flexible, and usable for a diverse audience, ultimately improving the experience for all individuals.

## FAIR principles and data accessibility in open data practices.

While digital accessibility focuses on making digital content inclusive and user-friendly, data accessibility is concerned with making data sets, databases, and research findings open and accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the general public. 

The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines and best practices designed to improve reusability of data, which refers to the ability to use existing data for different purposes beyond the original intent of its collection. 

The FAIR acronym stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability of data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure.

### Data should be _Findable_

Data and associated metadata should be easily discoverable and accessible by both humans and computers. This ensures that researchers, scientists, and practitioners can efficiently locate the data they need for their work.

#### A globally unique and persistent identifier for data and metadata

In order to be findable, (Meta) data should be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. These identifiers remove ambiguity in the meaning of the published data, they make it findable, allow computers to interpret it in a meaningful way, and help the people who reuse it to properly cite it. 

Many data repositories will automatically generate them when you store a datasets, but you can also use registry services that use algorithms to guarantee the uniqueness of the generated identifiers.

A few examples:

- [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)
- [https://www.doi.org](https://www.doi.org)
- [https://identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)
- [https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/](https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Descriptive metadata

Metadata provide essential context about the data, describing its content, structure, source, and other pertinent information. Extensive and descriptive metadata makes it possible to automatize some routine tasks which currently demand a lot of attention from researchers.

Examples of metadata frameworks:

- [https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/)
- [https://isa-tools.org/](https://isa-tools.org/)


#### Searchable resources to register or index data

Merely having an identifier and detailed metadata is not enough. The highest quality and most comprehensive datasets or digital resources are essentially useless if users are unaware of their existence. The process of ensuring discoverability of digital resources, particularly scholarly research data, is a critical step in facilitating efficient access and utilization of valuable information. 

There are various methods that address this issue, such as indexing, specializes repositories, and cross-linling refences. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout



- **Indexing:** Search engines send out crawlers that analyze web content, index it, and make it searchable. For scholarly research data, specialized indexing approaches tailored to the academic domain are necessary.

- **Specialized Repositories and Catalogs:** Uploading data to specialized repositories or catalogs relevant to the specific field of research enhances discoverability within the target audience.

- **Cross-Linking and References:** Creating links from related publications, datasets, or similar resources to the target dataset or resource can significantly boost discoverability. Academic papers that cite or reference the data also indirectly enhance its visibility.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



### Data should be _Accesible_

Within the FAIR principles, making the data accessible refers to making it easily available and retrievable to users and systems. It implies: 

- **Clear Access Protocols:** the protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP…) should be free (no-cost) and open (-sourced) and thus globally implementable to facilitate data retrieval and should ensure Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

- **Data Repositories:** Storing data in reputable and accessible repositories or data centers, which offer standardized access methods (e.g., APIs, web interfaces), enhances accessibility.

- **Standardized Formats:** Using widely accepted and standard data formats, such as Comma-Separated Values files, makes it easier for both humans and machines to access and interpret the data.

- **Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards:** Ensuring that data access complies with legal, ethical, and privacy standards to protect sensitive information while enabling appropriate accessibility.

### Data should be _Interoperable_

Data should be easily integrated with other datasets, applications, workflows of analysis and processing. For this, 

- Use a language to represent information that has precisely defined syntax and grammar, is shared and accessible so that others can learn it, and can be used in multiple scenarios (e.g. RDF, JSON LD).

### Data should be _Reusable_

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings:

- Described with accurate and relevant details.
- With a clear and easy-to-understand license for usage.
- Linked to its complete history and origin.
- Adhering to the standards relevant to its field.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Exercise: Multiple choice

Which characteristics ensure that data can be easily located and accessed within a searchable resource?

A) Data are assigned a unique and persistent identifier.
B) Data are described with rich metadata.
C) Data are locked in a secure vault.
D) Data are kept offline and inaccessible to others.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

A and B are correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

To make their findings openly accessible to the public, researchers have different options:

- Green Open Access (Green Route):

It involves self-archiving or depositing a version of a scholarly article or research output in a repository or other online platform. Typically, this is done after the work has been published in a subscription-based journal. Authors retain the rights to their work and can share it publicly without violating copyright restrictions. Green open access enhances the visibility and accessibility of research outputs.

- Diamond Open Access (Diamond Route):

Also known as "gold" open access, it involves making research outputs freely accessible immediately upon publication, and readers can access them without any paywalls or subscription fees. Diamond open access journals often cover publication costs through various means, such as institutional support, grants, or author fees.
